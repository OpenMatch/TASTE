## 

## Requirements

**1. Install the following packages using Pip or Conda under this environment**

```
python>=3.8
transformers==4.22.2
numpy==1.23.5
datasets==2.11.0
faiss-cpu
scikit-learn>=1.1.2
pandas
tensorboard
```

We provide the version file `reproduce/environment.yml` of all our used packages, if you have any problems configuring the environment, please refer to this document.

**2. Install openmatch. To download OpenMatch as a library and obtain openmatch-thunlp-0.0.1.**


```
git clone https://github.com/OpenMatch/OpenMatch.git
cd OpenMatch
pip install -e.
```

We do not include all the requirements in the package. You may need to manually install `torch`

**3. Prepare the pretrained T5 weights**

TASTE is built on [t5-base](https://huggingface.co/t5-base/tree/main) model，

You can download the weights from this link and place them in `TASTE/pretrained_model/`

## Reproduce TASTE

### Download Code & Dataset

Congratulations, you've done all the prep work. Let's get started !

First, use `git clone` to download this project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenMatch/TASTE
cd TASTE
```

Next, download our processed dataset from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U_tkCJq80kdefV9z_FdWDCMWvtUrm0or), please make sure that the files under the data folder contain the following before running::

```
data/
├── beauty/
│   ├── train.txt
│   ├── valid.txt
│   ├── test.txt
│   ├── item.txt
│   ├── train_name.jsonl
│   ├── valid_name.jsonl
│   └── item_name.jsonl
├── toys/
├── sports/  
└── yelp/
```

We have also provided a script for processing the data in the `TASTE/data`, so you can download the original dataset and use the script to process it yourself.

### Train then test

Next, start training the TASTE model
In the reproduce folder, we provide scripts for reproducing all TASTE models. Using the beauty dataset as an example, I will show you how to reproduce the results in the TASTE paper.

0⃣️ First.

```bash
cd TASTE
```

1⃣️ Training TASTE on the beauty dataset

```bash
bash reproduce/train/beauty/train_beauty.sh
```

2⃣️ Validate for the best checkpoint

```bash
bash reproduce/valid/beauty/eval_beauty.sh
```

3⃣️ Test for final results

```bash
bash reproduce/test/beauty/test_beauty.sh
```
